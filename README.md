# vuejs-video-loader-and-player

In this project I will be making a video upload box
which will take a video file as an input and display
the video in a custom video player.

# # IMPORTANT NOTE:
This project turns the entire uploaded video into
base64, which is a terrible idea, but since I didn't
know that at the time I am sticking with it.
